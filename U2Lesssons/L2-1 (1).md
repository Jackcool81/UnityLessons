# Lesson 2-1: Intro to Unity Scripting

Now that you have a good baseline of C#, we can now get into some Unity scripting. We will take the ideas learned in Module 1 and mix in some Unity specific tools and techniques to create custom functionality using C# scripts.

## Creating File and MonoBehavior

First, we will go over how to create the scripts. Go to the Project tab and go into the folder you want the script to be in. Right click in an empty place in the folder and go to `Create`, then click on `C# script`. This will create a script and will allow you to write the script name (so long as you don't click off of the script name).

Opening up the script, you will see this:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class NameOfScript : MonoBehaviour {

    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () {

    }

    // Update is called once per frame
    void Update () {

    }
}
```

Going through the script, we see two `using` statements: `using UnityEngine` and `using System.Collections`. `UnityEngine` contains all the Unity specific C# code that you will use when scripting. `System.Collections` contains collection items such as Lists. 

Moving down, we see `public class NameOfScript: MonoBehavior`. Everything before the ":" should be familiar. The `: MonoBehavior` is used to tell Unity that this script can be attach to a GameObject as a custom component. It also has some specific function, namely the `Start` and `Update` methods, which we will go over in a later lesson.

## Adding to GameObject

Once you are finished creating your scripts, you should check the Console Tab to see if there are any compiler errors.

After making sure all the errors are fixed, you can add your script to a GameObject. Attaching a `MonoBehavior` script to a GameObject will allow that script to start running when you click play. To add the script there are three ways, you could click `Add Component` and find the script, drag and drop the script from the project tab then into the inspector (a blue line will show up to signify where it will go), or drag the script from the project tab onto a specific GameObject in the hierarchy window.
