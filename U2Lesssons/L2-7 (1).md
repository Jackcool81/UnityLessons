# Lesson 2-7: Physics Methods

## Collisions and Triggers

Collisions occur when one collider object collides with another collider object. In this, Unity look at resolving the collision by checking with the physics engine. 

Triggers are special collision, where you still want to know about the collision, but no physics is applied at all. In this case, you need one collider to have the `isTrigger` box checked. 

For both, there is a 3D version and a 2D version. Both are separate, so you cannot mix and match 3D colliders with 2D colliders. We will only focus on 3D colliders for now.

**Note**: Inside the Collider and GameObject components, there is the `CompareTag()` method, which let's us compare the tag of the object to a string, which makes it easy to know what object we have. We will be using this for these examples below.

## On_Enter

This is called when an object enters the collider.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class OnEnterExample : MonoBehaviour {

    private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision other){
        if(other.collider.CompareTag("Player")){
            print("Player is colliding with us.")
        }
        else{
            print("Something is colliding with us.")
        }
    }

    private void OnTriggerEnter(Collider other){
        if(other.CompareTag("Player")){
            print("Player has entered the trigger.")
        }
        else{
            print("Something has entered the trigger.")
        }
    }
}
```

## On_Stay

This is called so long as there is a collider still touching the object.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class OnStayExample : MonoBehaviour {

    private void OnCollisionStay(Collision other){
        if(other.collider.CompareTag("Player")){
            print("Player is still colliding with us.")
        }
        else{
            print("Something is still colliding with us.")
        }
    }

    private void OnTriggerStay(Collider other){
        if(other.CompareTag("Player")){
            print("Player is still inside the trigger.")
        }
        else{
            print("Something is still inside the trigger.")
        }
    }
}
```

## On_Exit

When the other object leave, this is called.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class OnExitExample : MonoBehaviour {

    private void OnCollisionExit(Collision other){
        if(other.collider.CompareTag("Player")){
            print("Player has stopped colliding with us.")
        }
        else{
            print("Something has stopped colliding with us.")
        }
    }

    private void OnTriggerExit(Collider other){
        if(other.CompareTag("Player")){
            print("Player is exiting the trigger.")
        }
        else{
            print("Something is exiting the trigger.")
        }
    }
}
```
