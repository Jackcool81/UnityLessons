# Lesson 1-13: Final Project 

In this Final Project you will use everything you learned from Module 1 to fill out the skeleton code of a simple text turn based combat game!

To help with this process there are two functions that have been created for you, the first is **input()** which is just like in python it gets player input from the Terminal, the other is **Random.Range()** this is a "Fake" Unity method for generating Random Numbers.

## Part 0 Understand Skeleton Code
Access [Skeleton Code Here](https://github.com/Jackcool81/Unity2M1L13.git) you can get the repository or just copy the files **Project1Template.cs** and **Random.cs**

First it is recommended to look over the Skeleton Code to understand the various methods and variables that are provided. The main File you will work in is the **Project1Template.cs**. You will also need the **Random.cs** file.

## Part 1 Create Main Loop

To start we need a loop to cycle through the player and enemy turns, this is best accomplished with a **while loop** since we do not know how many turns the battle will be! In addition creating a while loop with a **boolean variable** can be a powerful tool since we will be able to control when the while loop stops. Lastly to check whether it is the Player or Enemy turn we can use **if statements**!
1. Inside the method **Main**, start off by declaring a boolean variable called *playerTurn* and intializing it along with the variable *running* to the value true. 
2. Create a while loop where the condition reads if *running* **is equal to** true
3. Inside your while loop create an if statement with the condition reading if *playerTurn* **is equal to** true
   1. If *playerTurn* **is equal to** true, call the function **player()** and set *playerTurn* to false
   2. Else, call the function **enemyTurn()** and set *playerTurn* to true

   
## Part 2 Commands Function

Before filling in our player method we need to list out the current state of battle and the available commands the player can take. So we are going to create our own **method** to print out this useful infomation. Before coding think of at least 3 creative abilities the player can take which involve damaging your enemy or healing yourself!
1. To store our abilities, Declare a new static String array called *playerActions* at the top of your class and intialize it with the string values of your abilities! (use *enemyActions* as a template)
2. Now create the static method, **commands()** with the return type void. This function is relatively simple to fill in all you need todo is print out the *currEnemyHP* and *currPlayerHP* aswell as each element in your *playerActions* array WITH **the value the user will need to input to activate said ability** <br>
    *Note*: You should use a **for** or **foreach** loop to print your *playerActions* Array!




## Part 3 Player Method

The **player()** method is what allows the user to interact with this game. In this Method we will take in user input to detemine what action the player will take. Depending on what action the player takes you will then need to randomly generate an amount dealt to the target. Finally display the action with the amount to the user and check if the enemy is dead. The **enemyTurn()** method has already been filled in for you so feel free to use it as a point of refrence if you get lost. 

*Note*: **input()** is a custom function that will collect user input from the terminal and *return* it as a **string**.

*Note*: **Random.Range(int start, int end)** is a custom function that will *return* a random number in the range indicated. (ex Random.Range(0,4) will return a number 0-4)

1. Start off by calling the **commands()** function to display the list of abilities the player can take
2. Now get the user input that will map to an ability, by Reassigning the *userInput* variable to the return of **input()** 
3. Next fill in the if statements,
   1. Reassign the integer *amount* to the return of Random.Range() 
   2. Depending on the chosen action, you will be either reassigning the variable *enemyCurrHP* or *playerCurrHP* by  subtracting the amount to **damage** or adding the amount to **heal**! 
   3. Assign the integer *num* to the index of whatever ability this if statement corresponds to 
4. Print what action the player just did using the *num* index and your array *playerActions* and the *amount* dealt (as a string)
5. Check if the enemy is dead using an if statement with the condition if *enemyCurrHP* **is less than or equal to** 0
   1. If *enemyCurrHP* **is less than or equal to** 0, set running to False and print You Win! 

*Note*: use the **toString()** method on int variables to convert them to printable strings (ex *amount.toString()*)
