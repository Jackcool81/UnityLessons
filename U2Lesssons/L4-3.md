# Lesson 4-3: Tilemap and 2D Extras
## Tilemap
---

Tilemaps are a collection of sprites (called tiles) that are in a uniform grid. This uniformity allows us to make quick changes to large groups of sprites, which is extremely good for level designing.

**To create the tilemap, right-click in hierarchy and go to 2D Object, Tilemap, and then Rectangular.** This will create two objects: a Grid and a Tilemap. The Grid object lets you control the attributes of the grid such as size, shape, and gaps. Beneath the Grid is your tilemap, which has a tilemap and tilemap renderer components. You can have multiple tilemaps on the same grid, where each tilemap can represent different layers. You can also add tilemap collider to a tilemap to create ground or walls for the player to collide with.

Now that we have the tilemap, we will go ahead and create tiles to be place there. First, open up the Tile Palette if it not already done so (**Window > 2D > Tile Palette** ). In here, you can add tiles to the palette to allow for easy access for painting. You can create a new palette by clicking the dropdown left of the "Edit" button and clicking on "Create New Palette". There should already be a palette called "Example Palette". 
To create tiles, you can just drag and drop sprites into one of the squares. There are a row of buttons toward the very top, which allow you to do stuff with the tiles in the tilemap. Here is a quick description of each:

1. Cursor: This allows you to box select a section in the tilemap.

2. Move: This allows you to move any selected (from the cursor tool) tiles in the tilemap.

3. Brush: This allows you to paint a selected tile to the active tilemap.

4. Box: This lets you box paint a tile to the active tilemap.

5. Eyedropper: This allows you to box select copy many tiles and then paint with them.

6. Eraser: This erases tiles from the tilemap.
    * Note: if you need a bigger eraser, use the eyedropper tool to make a big selection and then choose the erase button.

7. Bucket: This will fill in a common set of tile to another tile.
    * Note: Use this if you need large changes to tiles that are fully connected.

## Tilemap Extra
---

Unity has a package that contains some extra 2D components to make tilemaps more useable. Two useful ones are **rule tiles** and **random tiles** 

### **Rule Tiles**
Rule tiles allows you to specify what image the tile should be based on its neighbors

This is basic view of a rule tile, to create one click on the **Create -> 2D -> Tiles -> Rule Tiles** it will appear in the project window of your scene. The properties of a rule tile include:

   * Default Sprite: The default Sprite for this tile.
   * Default GameObject: The default GameObject set when creating a new Rule. (We can usually leave this blank)
   * Default Collider:	The default Collider Type set when creating a new Rule. (This will usually be Sprite)

### **Tiling Rules** 

Tiling Rules are used for defining how this tile will change in relation to it's neighbors. Creating a new rule is simple all you need todo is click the **"+"** button under the Tiling Rules which will bring up something that looks like this,

These properties are not to important to us now but we will be using the Output property soon. The output define's how the rule tile will function. Each **Output** type has its own properties which include Single, Fixed, Animation, and Random.

What we are really concerned about when setting up a rule tile is editing the 3x3 box. **The box symbolizes the neighbors a Tile can have**, the center of the box is the Tile itself. Clicking on a cell will set that neighboring tile with 3 matching options: Don't Care, This and Not This.

* Don't Care: The Rule Tile will not care about the contents of the cell in that direction (Blank cell)
* This: The Rule Tile will check if the contents of the cell in that direction is an instance of this Rule Tile. If not, the rule will fail. (Green Check Mark)
* Not This: The Rule Tile will check if the contents of the cell in that direction is not an instance of this Rule Tile. If it is, the rule will fail. (Red X)

### **Random Tiles**

To make a random tiles we will make use of the output property of a regular rule tile. Setting the output to random allows us to variants of the tiles and have them be drawn randomly.
