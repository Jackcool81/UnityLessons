**Open "Lesson 2" scene** for this exercise. This scene should contains a square, capsule, and circle. 

## Exercise 4.2.1
---
There are 3 sprites shapes (Circle, Capsule, and Square) in the scene, here is what you do:

* Rename the circle sprite to "Ball" and move it to the zero position.

* Rename the capsule sprite to "Paddle", move it below the Ball sprite, and rotate it by 90 degrees on the Z axis. Then resize it to at least be 3 on the Y value.

* Rename the square to "Respawner" and move to just below the bottom edge of the camera. Resize it so that it takes up the full bottom edge.

* You can change the colors of each of the sprite here to your liking.

## Exercise 4.2.2
---


For each of the sprites, we will add a 2D collider:

* For the Ball, add a Circle Collider 2D. Also add a Rigidbody 2D

* For the Paddle, add a Capsule Collider 2D.

* For the Respawner, add a Box Collider 2D and make sure "isTrigger" is check-marked.

## Exercise 4.2.3
---
For the Respawner and Paddle objects, we will edit then add some scripts to provide the collision functionality! 

* For the Respawner object, we need to edit the **Edge Respawner** script.
  * Open up **Edge Respawner** which should be in the scripts folder.
  * Change the **OnTriggerEnter** method from detecting 3D Triggers to 2D Triggers.
  * After the change is made and there are no complier issues add this script to the Respawner Object.

* For the Paddle, we need to edit the **SimplePaddle** script.
  * Open up **SimplePaddle** script which should be in the scripts folder.
  * Change both of the **OnCollisionEnter** and **OnCollisionExit** methods from detecting 3D collisions to 2D collisions.
  * After the change is made and there are no complier issues add this script to the Paddle Object.
