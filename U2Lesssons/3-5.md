# Lesson 3-5: Collect-a-thon

The goal of the game is for the player to collect all the inventory items on the map. You can open up your Inventory by clicking the **I** key on your keyboard. After your collect an item it will show up in the inventory.

### What you will use, **Arrays and Lists!**
---

For this exercise, we will be working on arrays and lists for creating an inventory for the Collect-a-thon mini-game. For additional information on Lists refer to lesson 1-11

`Array` Arrays are a used to store a collection of the same data. 
```csharp
    //Intialized with information
    public int[] inventory = new int[] {1,2,3,4};

    //just declared
    public string[] secondInventory;
```

`List` are extended arrays, which have more functions and can change its size during run-time.
```csharp
    //Creation of list
    List<int> powersOfTwo = new List<int>(){2,3,4,8};
    //Removing from a list
    powersOfTwo.Remove(3);
    //Adding to the list
    powersOfTwo.Add(16);
```
## Create Inventory List
---

For the player inventory, we will use a List containing **InvItem**, which update every time we add an item to the list. 

Inside the **InventoryScript**, 

* Add a public variable List\<InvItem> called **inventory**.

In the **OnTriggerEnter()** method, we will try to add an item. 
  * Check if the collider we entered has the **IvnItem** component (use .GetComponent\<T>() )  
    * If the collider has the **InvItem** Component, 
      1. Add the InvItem component to the **inventory** (using the **.Add()** method) 
      2. Set the other game object to false so you don't pick it up again.  (use .SetActive(false))

## Item Array
---

Since we are not spawning new items and we only need to refer when collecting, we will use an array to hold these values. 

* Inside the **CollectathonGameManager**, 
  * Create a public variable InvItem[] called **levelItems**. 
* Then, go back to Unity and open up the GameMenuCanvas and click on the GameInfo. In there you will see the **CollectathonGameManager** component. 
* Drag and drop each item in the level into the array from the inspector.

*Note*: You can drag and drop multiple items into an array by selecting all the items you want and then hovering over the array. You will see a plus sign on your cursor, meaning that all the items will be added. This makes it much quicker to add all the items.
