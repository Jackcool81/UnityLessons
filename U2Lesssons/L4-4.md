# Lesson 4-4: 2D Physics and Effectors
## Physics in 2D
---
Just like 3D, physics in 2D is pretty much the same, except you have one axis turned off and you have to add "2D" to the end of the components, just like the colliders. For instance, "Rigidbody" becomes "Rigidbody2D".

## 2D Effector
---
Often times, there are common physics effects we want to add in the game. For example, converter belts movement, buoyancy with water, and attractor/repeller. This requires the use of effectors, which are ways of applying forces to a sprite when it collides with or triggers the effector.

See Lesson 4 in the Unity Project to demo 


To apply an Effector to an object you first must make sure the effector is able to be used by the objects collider. To do this see if the "Used by Effector" box under the collider is checked.

Note: Some Effector Components will require you to uncheck the IsTrigger box.

Then you need to add the effector component to the GameObject. Here is a list of what each of the built-in effector components do:

* Area: Any object that enters this area will be move in a specified direction. These can act like vents or boosts.

* Buoyancy: Any object that enters this area will float as if it's on water

* Platform: Allows objects to pass through one way for a collider (e.g. going up through a platform when below it, but can stand on it regularly after being on top of it). This is mostly used for floating platforms.

   **Note**: This component require you to uncheck the isTrigger Box on the collider

* Point: This acts like a magnet, where they either attract or repel any object near the point depending on the option chosen.

* Surface: Any object that touches the surface of the effector will move in a given direction. This can be used for converter belts.
