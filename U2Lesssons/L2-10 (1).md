# Lesson 2-10: Unity Events and Scriptable Objects

Unity Events and Scriptable Objects are two ways Unity allows you to "code" functionality and manage data through the inspector without needing to use C#. This allows you more flexibility to make changes quickly and let's you manage how complex the game can be. 

***Note:*** While we will only be introducing these concepts at the moment for building game, keep note of this when we move onto more advanced Unity topics. 

## Unity Events

In programming, it is a best-practice to keep code as separated and extendable as possible, which allows you to very easily add new scripts without breaking existing scripts. Ideally, your code should not depend on any other pieces of code, since that creates a dependency on the other script. However, you may still want to tell those other scripts that something happens. To solve this, a design pattern we use is called the Observer Pattern, and in Unity specifically, we use Unity Events.

Recall when you had a button and wanted to add functionality to it. You added those functions to the `onClick` event. Unity Events generalize this to allow you to use it for any method in your script.  

Here is a simple example:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.Events;
using System.Collctions;

public class UnityEventExample : MonoBehaviour {
    
    //This is the variable to store our Unity Event
    public UnityEvent StartEvent;

    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () {
        //Invokes (Runs) the function
        StartEvent?.Invoke();
    }

    
}
```
Here is an example of this script attached to a GameObject, notice how the UnityEvent looks exactly like a button.

This is the same script but now it has an attached GameObject with a script called Test. When we run the game it will Invoke the method printHello.

## ScriptableObjects

ScriptableObjects are special data container classes which allow you to store many simple variants of a common class. For example, you can have an Enemy ScriptableObject, which contains all the common elements of every Enemy, such as health, speed, and attack damage. The big idea for Scriptable Objects is to allow you to create many different kinds of objects that you can just "plug-and-play" inside the game.

Here is an example with an Enemy ScriptableObject:

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

//This line of code creates a new  option in the Project Window context menu.
[CreateAssetMenu(fileName = "Enemy", menuName = "CustomObject/Enemy", order = 1)]
public class EnemyObject : ScriptableObject {
    public string enemyName;
    public int health;
    public float speed;
}
```

After creating the script we can create a new instance of the scriptable object in the project window.

You can then attach the new scriptable object from the project window to a script, and access the information it holds.
```csharp

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class ScriptableObjectTest : MonoBehaviour
{
    //We can connect a scriptable object by specifiying 
    //its data-type as the name of the script
    public EnemyObject enemy;

    void Start()
    {
        //We can access the scripts public methods and variables by using . 
        print(enemy.enemyName); //gets the enemy instances name
        print(enemy.health); //the enemy instances health
        print(enemy.speed); //the enemy instances speed
    }
}

```
