# Lesson 3-3: Zombie Attack Minigame

The goal of the game is for the player to kill as many zombies as they can. Zombies will spawn in random time intervals, clicking your **Left Mouse Button** activates your Shoot ability but it only has 20 bullets. After your Ammo depletes you need to wait some time before reloading. Each zombie you kill will increase your score!

### What you will use, **Game Object Operations!**

For this exercise, we will be working on GameObject creation (Instantiate), destruction (Destroy), and getting components (GetComponent<>()) to build up the Zombie Attack mini-game. *See Lesson 2-4 & 2-5 for more information.*

`Instantiate()` is a unity method that takes in a prefab object and outputs a clone of that object.  

`Destroy()`  is a unity method that takes in an object to destroy and time to destroy it, then destroys that object 

`GetComponent<T>()` is a unity method that outputs the component you wish to grab (replace T with the type of component) off a gameobject


```csharp 
        //Declaring a clone variable then intializing it to the Instantiate of a bullet prefab
        GameObject clone = Instantiate(bulletPrefab);

        //Collecting the BulletScript component from the clone bullet
        var bulletscript = clone.GetComponent<BulletScript>();

        //Destroying the current gameobject in 5 seconds
        Destroy(clone, 5f);
```

## Creating and Destroying Bullets
---

Go into the **FireProjectile** script and in the **Update()** you will see that there is already a conditional checking if the Fire button is pressed. Inside there:

* Create a variable GameObject called **bullet** and initialize it to instantiate of **bulletPrefab**.
* Set the bullet to be destroyed in **bulletActiveTime**.
* Get Component **BulletScript** from **bullet** and pass that into the **FireBullet()** function.
* Subtract one from the **ammoCount**.

## Spawning Zombies
---

Go into the **ZombieSpawner** script and then go to the **SpawnZombie()** function. Inside there, go ahead and add:

* A variable GameObject called **zombie** and set it to the instantiate of the zombie prefab.

* Set the **zombie** transform position to the result of **RandomPosition()**.

* Get the **ZombieScript** component from **zombie** and call the **Init()** method with parameter **target** and **this**.

## Killing Zombies
---

Go into the **ZombieScript** and inside the **KillZombie()** method, go ahead and create these lines:

* Call the **ZombieHasDied()** method from the **parentSpawner**
* Destroy this gameObject

After finishing up the script, we will need to attach the **KillZombie()** method to the OnDeath event. 

* In the unity editor, open up the Zombie Prefab and go down to the **HealthScript** component. You will see an event called **OnDeath()**. 
* Click the plus sign and place the **Zombie** into the empty slot. 
* Go to the drop-down, hover over **ZombieScript** and select **KillZombie()**. This should now make your zombies died after losing all their health.
