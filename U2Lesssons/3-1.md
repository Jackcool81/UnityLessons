# Lesson 3-1: Guess the Number 
The guess the number game is simple in esssence, a random number from 0-100 and you must guess what the number is. Each correct guess will give you a point! Try including hints to help the player out and make the game more interactive.

### What you will use **Conditional Statements!**
---

C# conditions will allow you to control the flow of your code to build up the Guess the Number mini-game. *Refer to Lesson 1-7 for more information on Conditional Statements.*

*General Code Structure*, enclose all if statement code in a **curly braces** {} as this tell c# to only run the code if the conditions are met
```csharp
    int myNumber = 10;

    if(myNumber < 10) //This has to be true to run the next line
    {
        Console.WriteLine("My number is a single digit");
    }
    else if(myNumber > 100)
    {
        //The first if statement must be false, 
        //and this else if must be true for the next line to run
        Console.WriteLine("My number is large");
    }
    else //all conditions before this need to be false
    {
        Console.WriteLine("My number is less than a million");   
    }
```

## Game Menu Manager - Pausing the Game
---
First, open up the **GameMenuManager** script and go to the **Update()** method, where you will see an if-statement for checking if the pause key was pressed. In here, add a simple conditional statement that will pause the game if **isPaused** is false and unpause the game if it is true.

## Guess The Number Script - Check Guess
---
Next, open up the **GuessTheNumberScript** and go down to the **CheckGuess()** method. We will need to add some if-statements, so here are some of the conditions you need to check.

1. Convert the string **guess** into an integer (use **int.Parse()**).

2. Check if the int **guess** is the same as the **currentNumber**.

   1. If they are the same, then add 1 point to the score and add to the **guessText.text** a message saying the player is correct (e.g. "You are correct!"). Then generate a new **currentNumber** and call **GenerateHints()**.

   2. If it is not the same, make a conditional checking if the guess is greater than or less than the **currentNumber**. Then, add to the **guessText.text** a message saying which side to go (e.g. "Your guess is too big.", "Your guess is too small.").

## Guess The Number Script - Generate Hints
---

For the final part of the game, you will be adding some hints to the game to make it easier to guess the number. You will use conditional to check if a hint is valid and add it to the **hints** string.

*Note*: Remember to add a "\n" at the end of every string.

Some example of hints:

* Is the number even or odd?

* Is the number less than 10?

* Is the number greater than 50?

* Is the number a multiple of 60?

* Is the number a perfect square?
