# Lesson 4-2: Sprites and 2D colliders
## Sprite
---
The bedrock of 2D game are sprites, which are images or textures we transform in the game. These can be thought of as 2D equivalent to meshes. At the basic level, you only need to do two things to work with sprite.

First, you will need to import the sprite and make sure it setting are correct for Unity. You can do this by clicking on the sprite in the Project tab and changing the values in the inspector. The most important parameters in the inspector are: 
* **Texture Type** will generally be "Sprite 2D and UI" which is what you want for creating 2D games with sprites.
* **Pixel Size** controls how many pixels from your Sprite fit into a single unit in the Unity when the scale is 1,1,1. (The image below is 99 x 106 pixels, with a Pixels per Unit to be 100, once I place my image into the scene the GameObject will be .99 x 1.06 units) 
  
  Note: Larger PPU values will mean more pixels are fitting into a single unit so the image will be smaller with more resolution , Smaller PPU values will make the image bigger with less pixels per unit thus have less resolution.

Second, to use the sprite in the scene, a game object needs to have a Sprite Renderer. Simplest way to do that is to drag and drop the sprite into the scene, which will automatically create and define the Sprite Renderer for you. Some useful parameters in the component are: 

* **Sprite** The image or texture the GameObject is using.
* **Color** Tints the sprite to be that color.
* **Flip** Used to flip the sprite in the horizontal and/or vertical directions (useful for movement).
* **Sorting Order** tells which layer to draw the sprite on (under Additional Settings).

## 2D Collider 
---


Like their 3D counterparts, in order for sprites to interact with the world, you need colliders. Unity separates 2D and 3D colliders, so you cannot mix them and must use one or the other. All colliders that work on 2D will have "Collider 2D" at the end of their name. The basic colliders we will use are: **Box Collider 2D** (2D equivalent to 3D Box Collider), **Circle Collider 2D** (2D equivalent to the Sphere Collider), and **Capsule Collider 2D** (2D equivalent to 3D capsule collider).

Note: In code, all you have to change for the OnCollider_/OnTrigger_ is adding 2D to the end. For example: OnCollisionEnter(Collision other) becomes OnCollisionEnter2D(Collision2D other); OnTriggerStay(Collider other) becomes OnTriggerStay2D(Collider2D other).
