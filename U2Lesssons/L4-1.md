# Lesson 4-1: Intro to 2D Unity

## 2D in Unity
---
For our previous modules, we have worked in 3D mode to create 3D games. However, Unity also has a 2D mode, which comes with its own built-in components to create 2D games. In this module, we will learn about how to make 2D games. For this lesson, we will go over two simple concepts for 2D games: cameras and sorting order.

## Camera
---
The camera defines how the 2D game is presented, whether it be side-scrolling, top-down, or isometric. In general, to make a 2D game, you force the camera to only move in two dimension. In most of our 3D games, we used perspective mode as this is how we see objects in real life. However, often in 2D games, orthographic is better, since it preserves the shape of an object regardless of size of the camera.

## Sorting Order
---

2D objects have no depth to them, so how do we know how to draw the character to be in-front of the background? This is where draw order comes into play, where we tell each object what order to draw in. Think of it like layers of paper, the higher in the order, the higher it will be drawn on the layer, which will make it be in front of other objects with lower draw order. For our game, you can control this with the "Sorting Order" option found in the sprite renderer.
