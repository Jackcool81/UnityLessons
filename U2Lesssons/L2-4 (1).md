# Lesson 2-4: FixedUpdate and GetComponent

## FixedUpdate Method

This is a special kind of update method, where the update loop is frame-rate independent (i.e. this updates on a fixed time-step regardless of frame-rate). You will often use this for physics update, such as those with Rigidbody components.

More info at: [Unity - Scripting API: MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate()](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.FixedUpdate.html).

## GetComponent Method

This method allows you to get a component from a game object. Very useful if you need a direct reference to an object's component and allows you to access to the component's public properties and methods.

```csharp
GetComponent<T>();
```


To use this method, you need to replace the T in between the <> with the name of the component you would like to get. (If the component is not on the GameObject there will be an error!)

For Example,

```csharp
GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
```

This can also be used for getting other scripts off of GameObjects,
```csharp
GetComponent<NameOfScript>();
```

If you want to get a component off of another GameObject not connected to this script, then you can prefix this method with the *referenced* GameObject. For example, 

```csharp
public GameObject text;

//Gets the TextMeshPro component off of whatever
//GameObject is stored in the text variable
text.GetComponent<TextMeshPro>(); 
```

## Example

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections;

public class FixedAndGetExample : MonoBehaviour {

    public Rigidbody rb;
    public float minSpeed;
    public float maxSpeed;

    // Use this for initialization
    void Start () {
        // This gets the rigidbody that is part of this game object
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }

    // FixedUpdate is called once per physics update
    void FixedUpdate () {
        // Move in random direction
        x_move = Random.Range(minSpeed,maxSpeed);
        y_move = Random.Range(minSpeed,maxSpeed);
        z_move = Random.Range(minSpeed,maxSpeed);
        rb.AddForce(x_move, y_move, z_move);
    }
}
```
