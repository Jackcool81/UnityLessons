# Lesson 1-1: C# Introductions and Syntax

In Unity, sometimes there are specific things you need done, but Unity does not provide them. This is where we have to use scripts to create functionality that we need. Unity uses a language called C# as its scripting language. C# is an object-oriented language and like other programming languages such as Python or Java, C# has variables, control flow statements, functions, and classes.
