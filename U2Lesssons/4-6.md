# Using DontDestroyOnLoad

Many times, we want to preserve information between levels, usually properties such as player health or score. This is where `DontDestroyOnLoad()` is useful, which pass a game object in as a parameter and tell Unity to not destroy the game object when loading a new scene. However, this means that you must destroy the game object manually or else the object will be there until the game is shut-off.

## Find GameObject by Components
---
Often time, you would like to get a component from a game object, but don't know it exactly. This is where `FindObjectOfType<T>()` can be useful (Note: `T` here means the type you are looking for). It allows you to find the first instance of an object that contains a component `T`. So long as what you are looking for is unique, you will be able to find it easily.

**Be aware: using this is computationally expensive, so try to save the object reference when you find it if you need to use it later. Otherwise, it can slow down your game.**

### Alternatives to FindObjectOfType
There are other functions in Unity used to find GameObjects without the use of components. These functions derive off of the GameObject module so inorder to use them you must prefix each one with GameObject. 


| Name     | Description | Example |
| ---------| ----------- |--------|
|  `Find()`  |    This function allows you to look up a gameobject in your scene by name! Then it returns that gameobject. (Be aware that if you change the name of gameobject you are looking for without changing the Find() function Unity won't locate it)         | `GameObject.Find("Main Camera")` |
|  `FindWithTag()`        |    This function allows you to look up a gameObject based on its tag! Then returns the first GameObject it finds.          | `GameObject.FindWithTag("BossZombie")` |
| `FindGameObjectsWithTag()` | This function allows you to look up multiple GameObjects based on their tag. Then returns all the gameObjects it finds as an array. | `GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag("Zombies")`
