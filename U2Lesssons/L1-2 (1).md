# Lesson 1-2: Creating C# file


## Replit File

Login to Replit.com and create a new C# file. Here is what Replit creates when creating the C# environment:

```csharp
using System;

class MainClass {
    public static void Main (string[] args) 
    {
        Console.WriteLine ("Hello World");
    }
}
```

This is the main file, which is always created and is the entry point of the program. Let’s break this file down. 

The first line contains a `using System`, which is like importing a library in Python. In this case, we can use classes that are found in the System library, specifically the Console class later on. 

Next is the `class MainClass`, which is the primary class defined in the main file. In Unity, it enforces that every file must have a class that matches its name (e.g. if a file is named `MyScript.cs` then the class name will also be `MyScript`). 

On the next line, we have `public static void Main (string[] args)`, which is the main function of the class. At least one class inside the file needs to to have a main function to be called. Think of this as the entry point for the program. When we will use C# in Unity, Unity will automatically handle this for us, but for now, make sure there is always a "Main" function in your script. We will talk more about the individual sections of the line in future lessons.

Last, we have `Console.WriteLine ("Hello World");`, which handles printing "Hello World" to the console. We will talk more about printing in another lesson.

Also recall that every code block uses "curly braces" (i.e. `{}`). 


## Downloading Visual Studio Code (Optional)

Downloading Visual Studio Code is not a pivotal component for this unit, although it is a great resource to learn and download for future projects in C# and Unity. 

1. First Navigate to https://code.visualstudio.com/Download and download and install Visual Studio Code for your appropriate Operting System  <br><br>

2. After Visual Studio Code downloads open it up and you will see a blank VSCode, on the left side of the screen click on the extension tab (The one with the blocks) <br><br>

Once you open the Extension tab you can search C# and install it.

3. Then you can Navigate to [NetInstaller](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/sdk-for-vs-code?utm_source=vs-code&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=sdk-install) and download the .NET SDK for your Operating System <br><br>

Restart your Visual Studio Code, and you should be Ready to start coding!

    ### How to set up Visual Studio Code

    1. Make a folder in your local files, and open it in the "Get Started" tab in Visual Studio Code. Or by Clicking on the top tab "File" then "Open Folder".
    2. In the output section at the bottom of your screen, under the "Terminal" tab type the command "dotnet new console" which will set up our Project for C#

    3. In the file called "Program.cs", copy + paste the starter Replit file mentioned [here](#replit-file)
    4. Use the "Terminal" to use the command "dotnet run" to run the Program! 






## Adding Comments

Comments are ways of adding messages to a program file, but that doesn’t affect the code. There are two main ways to add comments. For single line comments, we use `// Comment`; and for multi-line comments, we use `/* Comment */`. Here is an example:

```csharp
// This is a single line comment

/* 

This

is

a

multi-line

comment

*/
```

## Creating Variables

In C#, variables are also sometimes called fields or properties. **Variables hold values to be used for other pieces of code.** A good way to conceptualize variables, is to think of them as a box to store some type of information. For C# conventions, variable names use camelCase, where the first word has no capitalization, the remaining words capitalize the first letter, and there is no space between words. Example: `firstSecondThrid`.

For now, we will be using the keyword `var` when we want to define a variable. `var` tells C# to infer the **type** of the object. For example: `var x = 1;` means that the variable x will have  the type “int” and the value “1”. It is best practice to use the type name over `var` whenever you know the exact type (e.g. use `int x = 1;` rather than `var x = 1;`). This is because C# may not choose the same type as what you think it should be. We will discuss some common data types in a couple of lessons. 

```C#
using System;

class MainClass{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        //Storing the integer 1 into the variable (var) x
        var x = 1; //int x = 1; is better practice

        //Storing the string "Jack" into the variable (var) firstName
        var firstName = "Jack"; //string firstName = "Jack"; is better practice

        //Printing x will output the integer 1 to the console
        Console.WriteLine(x);

        //Print firstName will output the String Jack to the console
        Console.WriteLine(firstName);

    }
}


```
