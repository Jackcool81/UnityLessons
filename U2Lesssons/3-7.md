# Lesson 3-7: Rigidbody Exercises
We will be using the Cannonball mini-game to work with the rigidbody component. For this game, you use a cannonball to knockdown towers. **WASD/Arrow Keys** lets you control the position of the cannon, as well as control the cannonball when it is in the air. **Space** fires a cannonball. The **H** key let's you toggle the trajectory guide. All the code you will be writing will be for the **CannonballScript**.

### Get Rigidbody
---
Inside the **Awake()** method, add a line to get the Rigidbody on the current game object (use GetComponent\<T>()) and set **rb** equal to it. This will make sure we have access to the Rigidbody during the other two functions.

### Launching the Cannon
---
Inside the **Launch()** method, add **rb.AddRelativeForce()**. We use relative force here as that will make sure to launch the cannonball relative to the barrel angle. Make sure to pass in as parameters: **transform.up * power** and **ForceMode.Impulse**.

### Airborne Force
---
Inside the **Update()** method, add **rb.AddForce()** to provide control while the cannonball is airborne. For the parameter, the only one you will need is a **new Vector3(x, 0, z)** where **float x = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * airSpeed** and **float z = Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * airSpeed**.

### Explode Cannonball
---
Go to the **Explode()** method; this is where the cannonball explodes after hitting some solid block. There should already be a foreach loop getting every block object that will be affected.
* First check if the object is a block by Getting the Block Script off the object (use GetComponent<>() comparing it with null) 
  * If the object is a block get the Rigidbody from the block (call the **GetRigidbody()** method on block) 
  * Then apply the **AddExplosiveForce()** to the block with parameters: **explosionPower**, **this.transform.position** and, **explosionRadius**.
