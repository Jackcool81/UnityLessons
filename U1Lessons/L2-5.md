# Lesson 2-5: Navigation and Animation

## Navigation Mesh

One fundamental part of AI is being able to navigate through its environment. While we could use complex AI to see its surroundings and make plans accordingly, we can actually simplify the task of navigating using the navigation mesh. A navigation mesh (nav mesh for short) is a 2D surface projected onto the level which helps provide the path for the AI from its current position to its destination. Unity builds the Nav Mesh in the Navigation tab (found in Window > AI > Navigation)

Inside the Navigation tab, you will see 4 tabs: Agent, Areas, Object, and Bake. The Agent lets you specify different kinds of agents, as well as how tall and wide each are and what angles or steps they can walk on. The Areas lets you specify different kinds of areas, which provide different costs. For example, you can specify one area to be a roadway, which has less cost for the agent, since they move faster on roads. The Object tab shows what objects are selected, which can let you control where the NavMesh is drawn. Most of the time, you don’t need to select anything, as Unity is smart enough to know which areas are flat enough to place the mesh.

The final tab, which is the most important for our purpose, is the Bake tab, which contains a combination of the agent and object tabs. Like those tabs, you can specify the agent attributes and mesh variables in here, however, this only does one. Then, once you are happy with the results, you can click the “Bake” button in the bottom right corner, which will generate the NavMesh.

Once you have the NavMesh built, AI pathfinding is very simple (See above for the Nav Mesh Agent Component). For our case, all we need to do is supply a valid location on or near the nav mesh, and Unity provides a quick algorithm to pathfind to that location. Unity also provides the movement code, so we just need to tweak speed and turning values to get the appropriate movement.

## Asset Animation

Animation for our cases here means doing some movement to convey an action. Some types of animation are: recoil animation for firing a gun, jumping animation for moving over a gap, and idling animation when there is no input from the player. Animation is great for providing feedback and reactions to the users, as well as making your game feel more dynamic. At the moment, we will be doing simple, single action animation. In a later module, you will learn about the Animator, which can switch between different animation clips and do more complex animations. Most animation that is done in Unity will be through Keyframes, which are specific extreme frames. Then, when Unity plays the animation back, it will interpolate (fill in the animation gaps) between the keyframes, giving you animation. Below, we see the Animation tab, which lets you see the keyframes of the animation.

To access the Animation Tab navigate to the top tool bar and select **Window** > **Animation** > **Animation**, with the animation tab we can choose a specific property of an object to animate. We create this animation by changing the object, then recording its state with a keyframe on the Animation Timeline.

1. This is how we can tell which properties we are animating. For this example the transform position is being manipulated. So the property it's displaying is the cube's position.
2. This is the "Add Property" button using this we can add new properties to animate, these properties are usually components attached to the object such as the Transform (where we can edit Position, Rotation, and Scale)
3.  This is a "Keyframe", it records the state of object for this example we are manipulating the position of the object. So each Keyframe holds the state of the same cube but with a different position. 
4. This is the "Animation Timeline", it shows where we are in the current animation clip in seconds. As the clip plays the cube will take on new positional values in the transform moving the cube across the screen. 

In the following animation, we are manipulating the position property. The state of the cube is saved into three seperate key frames. Each Keyframe has a different position, and as the animation plays the values inbetween the keyframes are interpolated so the cube will move across the screen reaching each keyframe seemlessly.

**Creating Keyframes**

To Create a Keyframe you need to be inside of the animation tab on the animation clip you want to edit. 
1. First update the gameobject for whatever property you want to animate. For this example we will move the cube effecting the position property.
2. Second record the state of the object into a keyframe placed in the Animation Timeline. You can do this by right clicking and selecting the add keyframe button or double clicking on the Animation Timeline.

(To play your animation simply click the Play button right above where it lists the properties!)
