Lights in Unity provides the basic lighting setups for your games. You can use this to create lots of different moods and environments by just playing with the parameters.  Unity comes with many different kinds of lights, with the main ones being: directional, point, and spotlight. To create lights, you can right click in the empty space in the hierarchy (or click the “+” icon at the top of the hierarchy) and go down to Light.

### Directional Light

Directional lights are the ambient lighting that provides simple lighting to the scene. This can be thought of as the “Sun” for your scene and can often be seen in the sky if you have a skybox active in the scene. As the lighting is directional, you have the ability to change directions of the lightrays as well as create day-night lighting through rotating the light. Currently, this is the only light that has realtime shadows, meaning that you won’t need to pregenerate (bake) shadows.

Below, you will find an example of directional lighting. Key variables you will want to test out are the color (which provides a color tint to the light), intensity (how bright the light is), indirect multiplier (how strong the shadows are), and shadow types (these are: no shadow, hard shadows, and soft shadows).

### Point Light

Point light is a lighting setup where the light moves in all directions equally (this produces a sphere of light). You would often use this for light sources that illuminate in all directions such as light bulbs, campfires, and orbs of light. Unlike directional lights, shadows need to be baked in the lighting settings.

Below is an example of point light. Same key variables as directional light, except indirect multiplier won’t really work, since point light (as well as spot light later on) doesn’t have real time shadows.

### Spot Light

Point light is a lighting setup where light moves in a specific direction but spreads out in a cone. While similar to directional light in that both are directional lights, the main difference is that spotlight has a single point from which all light rays are started from. These are often used for spotlights, headlights, and light beams. Like point lights, shadows need to be baked in the lighting settings.

Below is an example of spotlight. Look at the same key variables as point light.

## Textures

Textures are special 2D images that are used to create more complex materials. Prior to using textures, you probably had some simple control over the color and reflectiveness of the materials. Now, with textures, you will be able to add new layers to your materials. To add textures to the materials, you will need to have some texture maps (images with specific parameters that tell the material how to look). There are many different kinds of texture maps, which we will discuss below.

### Types of Texture Maps

**Below is an image with an example shader that uses all the main map textures.**

Here is a breakdown of some types of textures maps that are used in Unity:

#### Albedo Texture Map

These are also known as Color and Diffuse. This provides the base color for the object, unaffected by lighting and shadows. You will often use this to provide the basic color of the object before applying other textures. When adding this texture, look for albedo, color, or diffuse in the name of the image. Here is a small example of a painted metallic albedo texture map.

#### Metallic/Specular Texture Map

Both Metallic and Specular texture maps both describe how reflective the surface of the object is. Often, this is black-and-white image, with black (representing 0) being non-metal (not shiny) and white (representing 1) being metal (shiny).

Note 1: Many textures come with a separate roughness map. For Unity, metallic and roughness are interconnected, so if you want to use roughness, combine the two images in your choice of image editor. However, for most cases, using either one is sufficient.

Note 2: If you have a specular map, remember to change from Standard Shader to Standard Shader (Specular).

#### Normal Texture Map

The normal map gives the illusion of depth by changing how light interacts at the surface of the object. This is done by telling the material to point light rays in a slightly different direction based where the light is coming from. Normal maps are usually blue, pink, and purple images, and have normal in their name.

Below is the normal map of the painted metal.

#### Height Map

The height map provides another very simple way of adding depth to the object. Height maps focus on creating depth by changing how different sections of the image look from each other (creating bumps and crevasses). Textures that have bump or height in the name usually go here. You can also place a displacement map here, though it will only act as a bump map (displacement maps in 3D modeling software can actually change the geometry of an object, at the cost of being more computationally expensive). Below is the height map of the painted metal.

#### Occlusion Texture Map

This image shows areas of shadow found on the object. Unlike shadows created by lighting, this allows a more fine grain control of how (ambient) light is hidden (or occluded) when transitioning from light to shadow.

Here is a simple example for the painted metal.

#### Detail Texture Mask

This controls values for the secondary texture maps. Since our games will not need too much details, we will not need to use this.
