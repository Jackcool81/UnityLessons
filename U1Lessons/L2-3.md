# Lesson 2-3: First Person POV
## First Person Character

![UnityEditor](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/969018400695259199/1009037128019230810/ezgif.com-gif-maker10.gif)
We will now move on to creating our own custom first person character controls. Our character controller has two parts: character attributes and first person controls. Character attributes are the general characteristics of the player character, mostly defined appearance and physics simulation. First person controller handles input from the player, which allows them to move and look around.

For character attributes, there are four main components we use: character mesh, collider, rigidbody, camera.

## Character Mesh
Character Mesh is the appearance of the player character. Meshes can be as simple as rectangular prisms and cylinders, to complex fully rigged player models you might see in professional games. For our game, we will use the simple capsule for our mesh, due to its useful collider.

## Collider
Speaking of that, some kind of colliders are required for the character to interact with the environment. Usually, we use a capsule collider since the spherical top and bottom reduces the risk of getting caught on terrain (unlike the Box collider) while also having the ability to change height easily (unlike the Sphere collider).

## Rigidbody
Next, rigidbody provides the physics for the character. We can mess around with the parameters (such as mass, drag, gravity scale, and so on) in the inspector. To prevent the capsule from rolling over when the game starts, we will be freezing X and Z rotation for the rigidbody.

## Camera
Finally, we have the first person camera. Unlike previous lessons, where we have a top level/bird’s eye view, we will be placing the camera in a more personal setting. Our placement of the camera will be inside the mesh of the character’s head. Since the inside of the mesh is not rendered, the camera will not be blocked by the mesh and you will be able to see at eye-level for your character.v

## Character Controller
Now, onto the character controller, which allows us to generally control the character. For the character controller, we have split up the script into 4 distinct parts, which should make it easier to test and build up your controller. When building your own script later on, you can choose to merge all the movement code into a singular script for more convenient use.

## Look Script Component
The look script component allows the camera to look around by moving the mouse. We use mouse dragging inputs to rotate the character and camera. There are two variables that you can control for looking around: sensitivity (controls how reactive the camera is to mouse changes) and smoothing (controls how smoothly the camera transitions).

~~~csharp
void Update() //Update is running every frame                     
{
    //Gets the X and Y position of our mouse. Storing it into a Vector2 called smoothMouseDelta then applying it to our currentMouseLook x,y
        Vector2 smoothMouseDelta = Vector2.Scale(new Vector2(Input.GetAxisRaw("Mouse X"), Input.GetAxisRaw("Mouse Y")), Vector2.one * sensitivity * smoothing);
        appliedMouseDelta = Vector2.Lerp(appliedMouseDelta, smoothMouseDelta, 1 / smoothing);
        currentMouseLook += appliedMouseDelta;
        currentMouseLook.y = Mathf.Clamp(currentMouseLook.y, -90, 90);
    //Setting the Cameras Rotation to the currentMouseLook X and Y coordinates 
        charCamera.localRotation = Quaternion.AngleAxis(-currentMouseLook.y, Vector3.right);
        transform.localRotation = Quaternion.AngleAxis(currentMouseLook.x, Vector3.up);
    
}

## Move Script Component
The move script component allows the character to move around (forward, backwards, and strafing to the side). We use the “Horizontal” and “Vertical” axis to get movement working, so you can use WASD or the Arrow Keys to control the movement (See the 2nd image with the input manager). You can also switch between walking and running by using the runKey (default is left Shift).

~~~csharp
void Update() //Update is running every frame                    
{
    //checks if our player is sprinting IF they are then set speed to runSpeed if ELSE keep it at walkSpeed
    if (Input.GetKey(runKey)) {
        float speed = runSpeed;
    }
    else {
        float speed = walkSpeed;
    }

    //Checks our user Input on the Horizontal and Vertical Axis, multiplied by our speed and the time that has passed (This will move our player smoothly around the map)
    float inputX = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal") * speed * Time.deltaTime;
    float inputZ = Input.GetAxis("Vertical") * speed * Time.deltaTime;

    //Moves our Rigidbody with our inputted axis's 
    rb.transform.Translate(inputX, 0, inputZ);
}

## Jump Script Component
The jump script component allows you to have the character jump when the jump key is pressed (default is Space). You can control the strength of the jump through the jump strength variable. A limitation of this component is that it requires you to tag any floor objects with the “ground” tag.

~~~csharp
void Update()//Update is running every frame 
{
    //Checks if the player presses the jumpKey and is on the ground
    if (Input.GetKeyDown(jumpKey) && isGrounded)
    {
        //if so add upward force to the players rigidbody 
        rb.AddForce(rb.transform.up * jumpStrength, ForceMode.Impulse);
    }
}
~~~

## Crouch Script Component
The last script, we have the crouch component, which allows the character to crouch by pressing the crouch key (default to left Control). What this does is force the capsule to become smaller, which moves the camera down and allows you to fit in smaller spaces. You can change how low the character crouchs through the variable crouch amount.

~~~csharp
void Update() //Update is running every                     
{
    //This checks if the player inputs the crouchKey 
    if (Input.GetKey(crouchKey))
    {   
        //if so set our Current Y to the crouch Y 
        float currentYVal = normalYLocalPosition - crouchAmount;
    }
    else {
        //if else keep our Current Y the same 
        float currentYVal = normalYLocalPosition;
    }
    
    //Applys the currentYVal to the players rigidbody 
    rb.transform.localScale = new Vector3(rb.transform.localScale.x,
                                                currentYVal,
                                                rb.transform.localScale.z);
}
