# Lesson 3-3: Checkpoints

### Introducing Checkpoint.cs & Death.cs
---
In this module, we will be going over two pre-made script called: **Checkpoint.cs** and **Death.cs**

**Checkpoint.cs** is placed into a GameObject that, when triggered, would update the Player’s latest checkpoint position.

Below are the configurations that come with the script:

**Starting Point**: Checking it means that the Player will teleport and plop on top of this checkpoint object at the start of the game. It will also update the Player’s latest checkpoint position. Leaving it unchecked means that the Player’s latest checkpoint position can only be saved when the Player touches the checkpoint object.


This is the Checkpoint Script.
~~~csharp
/*
This script is used for keeping track of which Checkpoint the Player is assigned to.

Once the Player touches a new Checkpoint, we reassign the old Checkpoint to the new coordinates.
*/

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Checkpoint : MonoBehaviour
{
    public bool StartingPoint = false;

    private Vector3 checkPosition;
    private Vector3 playerPosition;
    private GameObject player;
    
    // This function will run the code inside as soon as we click play
    void Start()
    {
        //This line of code sets the checkPosition variable to the transform position of this checkpoint object. (A Game Object with the checkpoint script attached)
        checkPosition = transform.position;
        player = GameObject.FindGameObjectWithTag("Player");

        //This checks if the Starting Point boolean (bool) is checked true
        if (StartingPoint == true)
        {
            //If true this checkpoint will be the Players spawn location
            player.transform.position = checkPosition; //Setting players transform position
            player.GetComponent<PlayerController>().Checkpoint = checkPosition; //Updating current checkpoint
        }
    }

    //This function runs the code inside whenever a Player collides with this checkpoint object 
    void OnCollisionEnter(Collision other)
    {
        //This line sets the Players new Checkpoint to the current position of this checkpoint object
        player.GetComponent<PlayerController>().Checkpoint = checkPosition;
    }
}
~~~

Death.cs is placed into a GameObject that, when triggered, would teleport the Player their latest checkpoint position.

The Death script has no configurations

This is the Death Script
~~~csharp
/*
This script is used for emulating a Player's "Death" by teleporting the Player back to their latest Checkpoint.
*/

using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

public class Death : MonoBehaviour
{
    private GameObject player;
    private Vector3 checkPosition;

    //This function runs the code inside whenever a Player collides with this Death object (A Gameobject with the Death script attached)
    void OnCollisionEnter(Collision other)
    {
        player = other.gameObject;
        //This line collects the players current checkpoint
        checkPosition = player.GetComponent<PlayerController>().Checkpoint;
        
        //This is the line that sets the players transform position to the checkpoint position
        player.transform.position = checkPosition;
    }
}

### Trying Out Checkpoint.cs & Death.cs
---

Let’s check out how we use TimedText.cs as an example in Unity. Head over to Assets → Scenes and open CheckpointsScene. Play the Scene to see how it works.

In this example Scene, it is required to have (besides the objects that come with a Scene such as Main Camera):

* A platform for every object to stand on. Our platform is Ground.
    * You don’t want objects to fall down.

* A character you can control in order to run and touch the trigger object. Our character is Player.
    * It is very important to include a Rigidbody component to your character, or else it won’t register the touch.
    * If you wish to reuse the Player already in the Scene, a prefab is found in Assets → Prefabs.

* A 3D object so we can attach the Checkpoint script to. Our objects are called Checkpoint.
    * Make sure one Checkpoint has StartingPoint checked.

* A 3D object so we can attach the Death script to. Our object is Death.
