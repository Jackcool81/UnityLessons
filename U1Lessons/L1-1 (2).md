# Lesson 1-1: Intro to GitHub
## What is Git
* A form of Version Control
    * Version Control is like checkpoints for your project. If you make a mistake or something gets corrupted, you can roll back to an old version and keep your progress.
    * Git is usually done through the command line, but there are many graphical user interfaces to help you manage your code (Such as Github Desktop)
## What is GitHub
* This is a site that allow you to host Git Version Control on a cloud server.
* Let's you share code easily without needing to send all versions directly.
* Also provides a backup location if you ever lose your code.
* You can create an account to host the code.

## Using GitHub
* This Curriculum will require you to Clone GitHub Repositories containing Unity Projects onto your machine using GitHub desktop

1. (Make sure Github Desktop is installed) Navigate to any GitHub repository link (for this example I used https://github.com/SurajSSingh/Module-2-Template.git) this will take you to the GitHub page for the repository from there click the green button called "Code" and select "Open with GitHub Desktop"

2. This will open on GitHub desktop follow the prompts to clone the repository it is important that you **Remember where the repoistory has been saved on your computer under "Local path"**

3. Lastly you need to open up the project on Unity Hub, 
    * First in the projects tab select the "Open" Button
    * Second Navigate to where you saved your repository from step 2, 
    * Finally select the project and click open in your file explorer/finder

    **(RECCOMMENDED)** Setting Up Unity's Default Project Location

    * Now make sure you change your default "Project Location" path to the **FOLDER** where you cloned your GitHub Repoistory in Part 2 (This is so you can easily set up future Repos that you will download)
