# Lesson 1-2: Getting Familiar

## Unity's Interface

When you first open Unity your default workspace will look like this. Let’s get familiar with Unity’s interface.

**1. Toolbar** - provides access to the most essential working features. On the left it contains the basic tools for manipulating the Scene view and the GameObjects within it. In the centre are the play, pause and step controls.

**2. Hierarchy** **Window **- is a hierarchical text representation of every GameObject in the Scene. Each item in the Scene has an entry in the hierarchy, so the two windows are inherently linked. It reveals the structure of GameObjects.

**3. Game View** - simulates what your final rendered game will look like through your Scene Cameras. When you click the Play button, the simulation begins.

**4. Scene View** - allows you to visually navigate and edit your Scene. The Scene view can show a 3D or 2D perspective, depending on the type of Project you are working on.

**5. Inspector Window** - allows you to view and edit all the properties of the currently selected GameObject. Because different types of GameObjects have different sets of properties, the layout and contents of the Inspector window change each time you select a different GameObject.

**6. Project Window** - displays your library of Assets that are available to use in your Project. When you import Assets into your Project, they appear here.

**7. Status Bar** - provides notifications about various Unity processes, and quick access to related tools and settings.

## Working in 3D

Since all of the projects we will be working with in this class will be three dimensional we should know each axis and the directions they are responsible for.

**X Axis** - also known as the horizontal axis. Moves left and right.

**Y Axis** - also known as the vertical axis. Moves up and down.

**Z axis** - also known as the applicate. Moves forward and backward.

## Creating 3D objects

***To create 3D objects in Unity simply right click inside of the Hierarchy, select 3D object and select the object of your choice.*** You can manipulate the size, position and rotation of each object by using the transform component in the Inspector or using the tools from the toolbar.

## Creating Materials

In Unity you can create materials to give a GameObject a specific appearance. In our case we want to give GameObjects different colors using materials. ***To create a material simply right click in the Project window, select Create and then Material.*** Make sure you rename your materials appropriately. For example, if you are creating a material for a wall then you should rename the material “wall”. Select the material you create to choose a color of your choice by selecting the color box to the right of “Albedo”. Next, you can click and drag your material from your project window onto the GameObject inside of the Scene View.

## Asset and Hierarchical Organization

As you start developing projects in Unity you’ll notice that your workspace will become cluttered with assets, scripts, game objects and more. For this reason, it is very important to stay organized to easily navigate through your project and manage its structure. Inside of the project window you are able to create folders to help you organize different parts of your project. ***Simply right click inside the project window, select create and then folder. Make sure to rename your folders appropriately.*** For example, if you are creating a folder for your scripts then you’ll want to rename the folder “scripts”. Follow this structure for all of your folders.

You can also organize game objects within the hierarchy by creating parents and children. If you’ve taken Roblox classes then this should be familiar. For example, if you have five different game objects that make up an object then you can create an empty game object that stores all of these game objects. ***To create an empty game object right click inside of the hierarchy window and select create empty.*** Once again make sure to rename your game objects appropriately.
