# Lesson 2-4: Audio and Input

## Unity Audio

Audio in Unity . There are two objects that are needed for Unity audio: Audio Clips and Audio Sources. Audio clips are individual audio snippets, which activate at a single given time. These can take many different audio formats, such as WAV, MP3, Vorbis, and so on. Here are some examples in the project folder.

Audio sources are what plays the sound clips. While it does have a slot for an audio clip, we will assign the clip directly to the scripts, since you can only have one default sound clip.

Technically there is another component needed for sound called Audio Listener (used to receive sounds from the source), however the main camera already comes with an Audio Listener. If you get a warning saying that there are two audio listeners, it is usually because you have two cameras active or you added a listener to another object.

## Mouse Input

Back when we made the First Person Character, the Look script used mouse position to move around the player camera. This used the Input MousePosition function to take the mouse pointer position and then move the camera based on the change of the mouse.

Just like keyboard Inputs, we can process mouse click inputs in multiple ways. One way is to get mouse clicks directly using the GetMouseButton function. When clicking, the mouse input is done with numbers (0 = Left Mouse, 1 = Right Mouse, 2 = Middle Mouse). The GetButton Input also works, mainly with the keywords: Fire1, Fire2, Fire3.

We have two scripts that utilize mouse inputs: Mouse Shoot and Mouse Pickup. First, the Mouse Shoot script allows the player to shoot at objects (and destroy them if they have a health script). To shoot, press the left mouse button. You can adjust the range and damage variables in the inspector. Second, the Mouse Pickup script allows the player to pickup objects that have the pickup component. To pickup an item, press the right mouse button. In the inspector, you can add a hand component and change the range and throw power variables. For these you will be adding them to your First Person Character in this lessonâ€™s exercise.

### Mouse Shoot Explanation

Inside of the Mouse Shoot Script's Update function we can see how our Mouse actually damages targets. In the Update function (which is a function that runs every frame), we check if the user presses the left Mouse button. If they do we will first play the sound we selected as our **fireSoundEffects** variable in our Inspector, then a Ray will shoot out in the same direction as wherever our player is looking. If that ray hits a gameobject we will check if that gameObject is damagable. If it is damagable then we will do damage to it equal to the **damage** variable we set in the inspector.

~~~csharp 
void Update() //Update function runs every frame (like a loop)
{
    if (Input.GetButtonDown("Fire1")) //Checking if the user presses Mouse button 1 (left Mouse)
    {
        //play a sound from the audio source
        source.PlayOneShot(fireSoundEffects);

        //Shoot a ray from the ray origin (starting place) and see if it hits a gameObject
        Vector3 rayOrigin = fpsCam.ViewportToWorldPoint(new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f));
        RaycastHit hit;
        if (Physics.Raycast(rayOrigin, fpsCam.transform.forward, out hit, range)) 
        {
            //We hit a gameobject! Make sure the gameObject is Damagable 
            //by checking if that object has the IDamagable script on it 
            if (hit.collider.GetComponent<IDamagable>() != null)
            {
                //if the gameobject is damagable do damage
                hit.collider.GetComponent<IDamagable>().TakeDamage(damage);
            }
        }
    }
}

### Mouse Pickup Explanation

Inside of the Mouse Pickup Script's Update function we can see how our Mouse actually Pick's up and drops gameObjects. In the Update function (which is a function that runs every frame), we check if the user presses the **Right** Mouse button. If they do a Ray will shoot out in the same direction as wherever our player is looking. If that ray hits a gameobject we will check if that gameObject is pickable. If it is pickable then we will pickup that gameObject by placing it it into our **Hand Transform**. Though in our else statement(which will run if click another button besides Right Mouse button), we will throw our cube with the Variable **DropPower** we set in our Inspector.  

~~~csharp 
void Update() //Update function runs every frame (like a loop)
{
    if (Input.GetButtonDown("Fire2")) //Checking if the user presses Mouse button 2 (right mouse)
    {
        if (pickedUpItem == null)  //checking if we already have an item in hand
        {
            //we don't already have an item in hand! Shoot a ray from the ray origin 
            //(starting place) and see if it hits a gameObject
            Vector3 rayOrigin = fpsCam.ViewportToWorldPoint(new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f));
            RaycastHit hit;
            if (Physics.Raycast(rayOrigin, fpsCam.transform.forward, out hit, range)) 
            {
            //We hit a gameobject! make sure the gameObject is pickupable 
            //by checking if that object has the IPickup script on it 
                if (hit.collider.GetComponent<IPickup>() != null)
                {
                    //the gameobject is pickupable, So pick it up !
                    pickedUpItem = hit.collider.gameObject; 
                    pickedUpItem.GetComponent<IPickup>().Pickup(handTransform);
                }
            }
        }
        else { //else runs if we already have an item
            //Since we already have an item, throw our current item
                pickUpItem.GetComponent<IPickup>().Drop(throwPower);
                pickedUpItem = null;
        }
    }
}
