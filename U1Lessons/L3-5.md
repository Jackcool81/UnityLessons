# Lesson 3-5: Importing 2D Textures

### Importing an Image to Use as a 2D Texture

**Textures** bring your Meshes, Particles, and interfaces to life! They are image or movie files that you lay over or wrap around your objects.

In order to create a **2D Texture**, scour the internet for an image and save as either a jpeg or png (allows you to have transparent backgrounds).

Once it is saved, make sure the file is placed into your Project’s Asset folder. In the Module 3 project file, you can find an image of grass located in **Assets → Textures**. This is an easy drag and drop.

Next, create a new **Material** and assign the **Albedo** property to your texture image.

Drag the *Material* to a **3D object** you want to apply the texture with.

You may notice how bloated the image looks. In order to shrink the image, select the **Material** to open its **Inspector**. Search for **Tiling** in the **Main Maps** section (not Secondary Maps) and change the **X** and **Y**.

Keep in mind why it is called **Tiling**. We are multiplying the amount of image tiles we want to fit in the object.

* For example, the default is 1 x 1, meaning we only have 1 big tile of that texture.
* If we change it to 2 x 2, we will have 4 tiles of that texture organized as a 2 by 2 grid like the image below.


1 x 1         |  2 x 2

### Creating a Normal Map for your Texture

**Normal Maps** are extremely helpful for creating realistic textures as the provide depth to an image. If you remember back to Lesson 2-1, you will remember there is a simple tool to create your own height maps. It is called **Normal Map Online**, you can put in any image and it will auto generate a height map for you.

To use this first upload an image from your computer (This works better if the size of the picture has a 1:1 ratio which is a power of 2) For this example I will use the Rock Sharp Albedo image located in the **Assets → Textures** Folder.

From this screen you can change multiple different parameters for the Normal Map it also shows what your normal map will look like in their 3D Preview. Go ahead and play around with the Parameters until you think it looks good. 

You then just need to download your Normal Map image (it's default location will be your Downloads folder). Next import the image into Unity, this can be done by simply dragging the image into the **Assets → Textures** Folder. 



Then you want to create a New material and assign the image to the Normal Map Property.  Once there attach it onto your 3D Object.

Use Albedo images with your height maps to really make them pop as shown in the GIF above.
