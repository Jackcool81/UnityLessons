# Lesson 3-2: Appearing/Disappearing UI-Text

## More Into TextMeshPro

Introducing **TextMeshPro (TMP)** and how we will be going more in-depth with customization. TMP has many text appearance, formatting options, and is an easy way to add a professional touch to any project’s user interface.

### Creating a TextMeshPro Object

To create a TMP object, right-click in the Hierarchy window, select **UI → TextMeshPro → Text**.

The first time you use TMP in a project, Unity will offer to import the TMP Essentials and Examples & Extras packages ( *Only the TMP Essentials is required if it hasn’t been imported already* ).

If the text isn’t visible in the Scene tab, select the Text (TMP) object in the Hierarchy, then press the ‘**SHIFT’ + ‘F’** key to focus towards the object.

Another way to view the text is through the Game tab. This will allow you to view how and what the position of the text looks like in the eyes of the game camera.

| **Font Asset:** The Font Asset containing the glyphs that can be rendered for this text |
| **Material Preset:** The material used for rendering. Only materials created from Font Asset can be used. |
| **Font Style:** Styles to apply the text such as Bold and Italic. |
| **Font Size:** The size the text will be rendered in.        |
| **Vertex Color:** The base color of the text.                |
| **Color Gradient:** The gradient color applied over the Vertex Color. |
| **Alignment:** Horizontal and Vertical alignment of the text within its container. |

### Creating a Color Gradient for TextMeshPro

To enable more than one color assigned to our text, we will be creating a Color Gradient to give our text some more flair.

**Note:** Make sure the Vertex Color is left as white!

1. In the TMP’s Inspector search for the Color Gradient option and check it on.
2. Inside Color Gradient, you will find Color Mode with 4 different options. 
3. Once you have selected an option, choose the colors you want to assign to each side.

## Introducing TimedText.cs

In this module, we will be going over a pre-made script called: **TimedText.cs**

TimedText.cs is placed into a GameObject that, when triggered, would cause a Text object of our choice to appear for a certain duration before disappearing again.

Below are the configurations that come with the script:

**Chosen Text:** Place a TextMeshPro object into this slot. This will be the text that appears/disappears.

**Duration:** This is how long you want the text to stay onscreen in seconds.

**This is the C# code in the Timed Text Script:**
~~~csharp
    //These are variables 
    public TMP_Text ChosenText; //Holds a Reference to TextMeshPro 
    public float Duration = 1f; //Holds a Float to the Value 1
    

    
    void Start() //A function called Start, the Code inside will run when we play
    {
        
        ChosenText.gameObject.SetActive(false); //This disables the ChosenText (We can't see the text)
    }

    //A function called OnCollisionEnter, the Code inside will run when a collision occurs with the GameObject this script is attached to
    void OnCollisionEnter()
    {
        StartCoroutine(timer()); //Runs the code in the function timer
    }


    IEnumerator timer() //A function called timer, which will enable the text for the Duration then disable it
    {
      
        ChosenText.gameObject.SetActive(true); //this Enables the ChosenText (We can see the Text) 
        
        //this makes our code stop running and wait for the Duration in seconds
        yield return new WaitForSeconds(Duration); //This is similar to Pythons time.sleep() or Roblox Studio wait() functions

      
        ChosenText.gameObject.SetActive(false);
    }
~~~



## Trying Out TimedText.cs

Let’s check out how we use TimedText.cs as an example in Unity. Head over to **Assets → Scenes** and open **TimedTextScene**. Play the Scene to see how it works.

In this example Scene, it is required to have (besides the objects that come with a Scene such as Main Camera):

- A platform for every object to stand on. Our platform is **Ground**.
  - You don’t want objects to fall down.

- A character you can control in order to run and touch the trigger object. Our character is **Player**.
  - It is very important to include a **Rigidbody** component to your character, or else it won’t register the touch.
  - If you wish to reuse the Player already in the Scene, a prefab is found in **Assets → Prefabs**.

- A Text (TMP) object so we can have it appear and disappear. Out text is located inside the **Canvas**.
  - Making any UI object will automatically make a Canvas object if there isn’t one already.

- A 3D object so we can attach the TimedText script to. Our object is **TimedText**.

Open up TimedText to view notes describing what some lines of code does.
